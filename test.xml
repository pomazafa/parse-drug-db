                        <paragraph>The recommended starting dosage is 4.5 grams (g) per night administered orally, divided into two doses: 2.25 g at bedtime and 2.25 g taken 2.5 to 4 hours later (see Table 1). Increase the dosage by up to 1.5 g per night per week (e.g., 0.75 g at bedtime and 0.75 g taken 2.5 to 4 hours later), to the recommended dosage range of 6 g to 9 g per night. The dosage may be gradually titrated based on efficacy and tolerability. Some patients may achieve better responses with unequal doses at bedtime and 2.5 to 4 hours later. Doses higher than 9 g per night have not been studied and ordinarily should not be administered.</paragraph>

Prior to ingestion, each dose of XYWAV should be diluted with approximately ¼ cup (approximately 60 mL) of water in the empty pharmacy containers provided. Solutions prepared following dilution should be consumed within 24 hours.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Take the first nightly dose of XYWAV at least 2 hours after eating.

                        <paragraph>Patients may need to set an alarm to awaken for the second dose. If the second dose is missed, that dose should be skipped and XYWAV should not be taken again until the next night. Two XYWAV doses should never be taken at one time.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.1 Central Nervous System Depression</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>XYWAV is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant. Clinically significant respiratory depression and obtundation has occurred in adult patients taking sodium oxybate (same active moiety as XYWAV) at recommended doses in clinical trials and may occur in patients treated with XYWAV at recommended doses. XYWAV is contraindicated in combination with alcohol and sedative hypnotics. The concurrent use of XYWAV with other CNS depressants, including but not limited to opioid analgesics, benzodiazepines, sedating antidepressants or antipsychotics, sedating anti-epileptic drugs, general anesthetics, muscle relaxants, and/or illicit CNS depressants, may increase the risk of respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, syncope, and death.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If use of these CNS depressants in combination with XYWAV is required, dose reduction or discontinuation of one or more CNS depressants (including XYWAV) should be considered. In addition, if short-term use of an opioid (e.g., post- or perioperative) is required, interruption of treatment with XYWAV should be considered.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Healthcare providers should caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles or airplanes, until they are reasonably certain that XYWAV does not affect them adversely (e.g., impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills). Patients should not engage in hazardous occupations or activities requiring complete mental alertness or motor coordination, such as operating machinery or a motor vehicle or flying an airplane, for at least 6 hours after taking XYWAV. Patients should be queried about CNS depression‐related events upon initiation of XYWAV therapy and periodically thereafter.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>XYWAV is available only through a restricted program under a REMS <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#i4i_section_id_80a9bf53-ecb8-4892-91f6-cf4c086a7106">5.3</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.2 Abuse and Misuse</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>XYWAV is a Schedule III controlled substance. The active moiety of XYWAV is oxybate, also known as gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), a Schedule I controlled substance. Abuse of illicit GHB, either alone or in combination with other CNS depressants, is associated with CNS adverse reactions, including seizure, respiratory depression, decreases in the level of consciousness, coma, and death. The rapid onset of sedation, coupled with the amnestic features of GHB, particularly when combined with alcohol, has proven to be dangerous for the voluntary and involuntary user (e.g., assault victim). Because illicit use and abuse of GHB have been reported, healthcare providers should carefully evaluate patients for a history of drug abuse and follow them closely, particularly for signs of misuse or abuse of GHB (including but not limited to increase in size or frequency of dosing, drug-seeking behavior, feigned cataplexy) <content styleCode="italics">[see Drug Abuse and Dependence (<linkHtml href="#ID_537f8324-e247-4c0b-b9a0-2486775e4078">9.2</linkHtml>)]</content>. If abuse is suspected, treatment with XYWAV should be discontinued<content styleCode="italics">. </content>

                        <paragraph>XYWAV may impair respiratory drive, especially in patients with compromised respiratory function. In overdoses of oxybate and with illicit use of GHB, life-threatening respiratory depression has been reported <content styleCode="italics">[see Overdosage (<linkHtml href="#i4i_overdosage_id_b9d3653c-35c2-4c13-b43d-48152a1b9279">10</linkHtml>)]. </content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Increased apnea and reduced oxygenation may occur with XYWAV administration in adult and pediatric patients. A significant increase in the number of central apneas and clinically significant oxygen desaturation may occur in patients with obstructive sleep apnea treated with XYWAV.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a study assessing the respiratory-depressant effects of Xyrem (same active moiety as XYWAV) at doses up to 9 g per night in 21 adult patients with narcolepsy, no dose-related changes in oxygen saturation were demonstrated in the group as a whole. One of the four patients with preexisting, moderate-to-severe sleep apnea had significant worsening of the apnea/hypopnea index during treatment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a study assessing the effects of Xyrem 9 g per night in 50 adult patients with obstructive sleep apnea, Xyrem did not increase the severity of sleep‑disordered breathing and did not adversely affect the average duration and severity of oxygen desaturation overall. However, there was a significant increase in the number of central apneas in patients taking Xyrem, and clinically significant oxygen desaturation (≤55%) was measured in three patients (6%) after Xyrem administration, with one patient withdrawing from the study and two continuing after single brief instances of desaturation.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>During polysomnographic evaluation (PSG), central sleep apnea and oxygen desaturation were observed in pediatric patients with narcolepsy treated with Xyrem. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Prescribers should be aware that increased central apneas and clinically relevant desaturation events have been observed with sodium oxybate administration in adult and pediatric patients.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In clinical trials of Xyrem in 128 adult patients with narcolepsy, two patients had profound CNS depression, which resolved after supportive respiratory intervention. Two other patients discontinued sodium oxybate because of severe difficulty breathing and an increase in obstructive sleep apnea. In two controlled trials assessing PSG measures in adult patients with narcolepsy, 40 of 477 patients were included with a baseline apnea/hypopnea index of 16 to 67 events per hour, indicative of mild to severe sleep-disordered breathing. None of the 40 patients had a clinically significant worsening of respiratory function, as measured by apnea/hypopnea index and pulse oximetry at doses of 4.5 g to 9 g per night.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Prescribers should be aware that sleep-related breathing disorders tend to be more prevalent in obese patients, in men, in postmenopausal women not on hormone replacement therapy, and among patients with narcolepsy.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Depression, and suicidal ideation and behavior can occur in patients treated with XYWAV.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In Study 1, depression and depressed mood were reported in 3% and 4%, respectively, of patients treated with XYWAV. Two patients (1%) discontinued XYWAV because of depression, but in most cases, no change in XYWAV treatment was required.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In clinical trials of Xyrem (same active moiety as XYWAV) in adult patients with narcolepsy (n=781), there were two suicides and two attempted suicides in patients treated with Xyrem, including three patients with a previous history of depressive psychiatric disorder. Of the two suicides, one patient used Xyrem in conjunction with other drugs. Xyrem was not involved in the second suicide. Adverse reactions of depression were reported by 7% of 781 patients treated with Xyrem, with four patients (&lt;1%) discontinuing because of depression. <content styleCode="xmChange">In most cases, no change in Xyrem treatment was required. In a clinical trial with Xyrem in pediatric patients with narcolepsy (n=104), one patient experienced suicidal ideation and two patients reported depression while taking Xyrem.</content>

                        <paragraph>Parasomnias can occur in patients taking XYWAV.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In Study 1, parasomnias, including sleepwalking, were reported in 6% of patients treated with XYWAV. In a clinical trial of Xyrem (same active moiety as XYWAV) in adult patients with narcolepsy, five instances of sleepwalking with potential injury or significant injury were reported. Parasomnias, including sleepwalking, also have been reported in a pediatric clinical trial with sodium oxybate and in postmarketing experience with sodium oxybate.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Episodes of sleepwalking should be fully evaluated and appropriate interventions considered. </paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The safety of XYWAV was evaluated in a 16‑week double-blind placebo-controlled randomized-withdrawal study in patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy (Study 1), which was followed by an open-label extension phase lasting 24 weeks <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Studies (<linkHtml href="#ID_d9c75604-4c43-45bd-9ab2-2adfca852e6f">14.1</linkHtml>)]</content>. Study 1 included an open‑label titration period (OL OTTP), a stable-dose period (SDP), and a double‑blind, placebo‑controlled, randomized-withdrawal period (DB RWP). A total of 201 patients, ages 18 to 70 years, received XYWAV at individually titrated doses for 14 weeks, followed by randomization to XYWAV or matching placebo for 2 weeks of treatment. The mean exposure to XYWAV during this study, including titration, the randomized withdrawal period, and the open-label extension, was 151 days. In patients who remained on treatment, adverse reactions tended to occur early and diminish over time.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In Study 1, 9 of 201 patients (4%) reported adverse reactions that led to withdrawal from the study (anxiety, decreased appetite, depressed mood, depression, fatigue, headache, irritability, nausea, pain in extremity, parasomnia, somnolence, and vomiting). The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was nausea (1.5%). The majority of adverse reactions leading to discontinuation began during the first few weeks of treatment.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of XYWAV or sodium oxybate in pregnant women. Oral administration of sodium oxybate to pregnant rats (0, 150, 350, or 1,000 mg/kg/day) or rabbits (0, 300, 600, or 1,200 mg/kg/day) throughout organogenesis produced no clear evidence of developmental toxicity; however, oral administration to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation resulted in increased stillbirths and decreased offspring postnatal viability and growth, at a clinically relevant dose <content styleCode="italics">[see Data]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.

                        <paragraph>XYWAV has not been studied in labor or delivery. In obstetric anesthesia using an injectable formulation of sodium oxybate, newborns had stable cardiovascular and respiratory measures but were very sleepy, causing a slight decrease in Apgar scores. There was a fall in the rate of uterine contractions 20 minutes after injection. Placental transfer is rapid, and gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) has been detected in newborns at delivery after intravenous administration of GHB to mothers. Subsequent effects of sodium oxybate on later growth, development, and maturation in humans are unknown.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Clinical studies of XYWAV or Xyrem in patients with narcolepsy did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In clinical studies of sodium oxybate in another population, 39 (5%) of 874 patients were 65 years or older. Discontinuations of treatment due to adverse reactions were increased in the elderly compared to younger adults (21% vs. 19%). Frequency of headaches was markedly increased in the elderly (39% vs. 19%). The most common adverse reactions were similar in both age categories. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The active moiety of XYWAV, oxybate, produces dose-dependent central nervous system effects, including hypnotic and positive subjective reinforcing effects. The onset of effect is rapid, enhancing its potential for abuse or misuse.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Drug abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a drug product or substance, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects<content styleCode="italics">.</content> Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a health care provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Drug misuse and abuse may occur with or without progression to addiction. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The rapid onset of sedation, coupled with the amnestic features of GHB, particularly when combined with alcohol, has proven to be dangerous for the voluntary and involuntary user (e.g., assault victim).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Illicit GHB is abused in social settings primarily by young adults. Some of the doses estimated to be abused are in a similar dosage range to that used for treatment of patients with cataplexy. GHB has some commonalities with ethanol over a limited dose range, and some cross tolerance with ethanol has been reported as well. Cases of severe dependence and craving for GHB have been reported when the drug is taken around the clock. Patterns of abuse indicative of dependence include: 1) the use of increasingly large doses, 2) increased frequency of use, and 3) continued use despite adverse consequences.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Because illicit use and abuse of GHB have been reported, physicians should carefully evaluate patients for a history of drug abuse and follow such patients closely, observing them for signs of misuse or abuse of GHB (e.g., increase in size or frequency of dosing, drug-seeking behavior, feigned cataplexy). Dispose of XYWAV according to state and federal regulations. It is safe to dispose of XYWAV down the sanitary sewer.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. There have been case reports of withdrawal, ranging from mild to severe, following discontinuation of illicit use of GHB at frequent repeated doses (18 g to 250 g per day) in excess of the recommended dosage range. Signs and symptoms of GHB withdrawal following abrupt discontinuation included insomnia, restlessness, anxiety, psychosis, lethargy, nausea, tremor, sweating, muscle cramps, tachycardia, headache, dizziness, rebound fatigue and sleepiness, confusion, and, particularly in the case of severe withdrawal, visual hallucinations, agitation, and delirium. These symptoms generally abated in 3 to 14 days. In cases of severe withdrawal, hospitalization may be required. The discontinuation effects of XYWAV have not been systematically evaluated in controlled clinical trials. In the clinical trial experience with Xyrem in narcolepsy/cataplexy patients at recommended doses, two patients reported anxiety and one reported insomnia following abrupt discontinuation at the termination of the clinical trial; in the two patients with anxiety, the frequency of cataplexy had increased markedly at the same time. In the XYWAV clinical trial in adult narcolepsy/cataplexy patients at recommended doses, one patient reported insomnia following abrupt discontinuation of XYWAV.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Tolerance to XYWAV has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. There have been some case reports of symptoms of tolerance developing after illicit use at dosages far in excess of the recommended XYWAV dosage regimen. Clinical studies of sodium oxybate in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal suggest a potential cross-tolerance with alcohol. The safety and effectiveness of XYWAV in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal have not been established.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Information regarding overdose with XYWAV is derived largely from reports in the medical literature that describe symptoms and signs in individuals who have ingested GHB illicitly. In these circumstances the co-ingestion of other drugs and alcohol was common, and may have influenced the presentation and severity of clinical manifestations of overdose. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In adult clinical trials with Xyrem (same active moiety as XYWAV), two cases of overdose were reported. In the first case, an estimated dose of 150 g, more than 15 times the maximum recommended dose, caused a patient to be unresponsive with brief periods of apnea and to be incontinent of urine and feces. This individual recovered without sequelae. In the second case, death was reported following a multiple drug overdose consisting of Xyrem and numerous other drugs. No cases of overdose (greater than 9 g) with XYWAV were reported in the XYWAV clinical trial.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Information about signs and symptoms associated with overdosage with XYWAV derives from reports of illicit use of GHB. Patient presentation following overdose is influenced by the dose ingested, the time since ingestion, the co-ingestion of other drugs and alcohol, and the fed or fasted state. Patients have exhibited varying degrees of depressed consciousness that may fluctuate rapidly between a confusional, agitated combative state with ataxia and coma. Emesis (even when obtunded), diaphoresis, headache, and impaired psychomotor skills have been observed. No typical pupillary changes have been described to assist in diagnosis; pupillary reactivity to light is maintained. Blurred vision has been reported. An increasing depth of coma has been observed at higher doses. Myoclonus and tonic-clonic seizures have been reported. Respiration may be unaffected or compromised in rate and depth. Cheyne-Stokes respiration and apnea have been observed. Bradycardia and hypothermia may accompany unconsciousness, as well as muscular hypotonia, but tendon reflexes remain intact.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>General symptomatic and supportive care should be instituted immediately, and gastric decontamination may be considered if co-ingestants are suspected. Because emesis may occur in the presence of obtundation, appropriate posture (left lateral recumbent position) and protection of the airway by intubation may be warranted. Although the gag reflex may be absent in deeply comatose patients, even unconscious patients may become combative to intubation, and rapid-sequence induction (without the use of sedative) should be considered. Vital signs and consciousness should be closely monitored. The bradycardia reported with GHB overdose has been responsive to atropine intravenous administration. No reversal of the central depressant effects of XYWAV can be expected from naloxone or flumazenil administration. The use of hemodialysis and other forms of extracorporeal drug removal have not been studied in GHB overdose. However, due to the rapid metabolism of oxybate, these measures are not warranted.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>XYWAV is a CNS depressant. The exact mechanism of action of XYWAV in the treatment of narcolepsy is unknown. XYWAV is a mixture of calcium oxybate, magnesium oxybate, potassium oxybate, and sodium oxybate (gamma-hydroxybutyrate). Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is an endogenous compound and metabolite of the neurotransmitter GABA. It is hypothesized that the therapeutic effects of XYWAV on cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness are mediated through GABA<sub>B</sub> actions during sleep at noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurons, as well as at thalamocortical neurons.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Animal studies indicate that metabolism is the major elimination pathway for GHB, producing carbon dioxide and water via the tricarboxylic acid (Krebs) cycle and secondarily by beta-oxidation. The primary pathway involves a cytosolic NADP<sup>+</sup>-linked enzyme, GHB dehydrogenase, that catalyzes the conversion of GHB to succinic semialdehyde, which is then biotransformed to succinic acid by the enzyme succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase. Succinic acid enters the Krebs cycle where it is metabolized to carbon dioxide and water. A second mitochondrial oxidoreductase enzyme, a transhydrogenase, also catalyzes the conversion to succinic semialdehyde in the presence of α-ketoglutarate. An alternate pathway of biotransformation involves β-oxidation via 3,4-dihydroxybutyrate to carbon dioxide and water. No active metabolites have been identified.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The clearance of GHB is almost entirely by biotransformation to carbon dioxide, which is then eliminated by expiration. On average, less than 5% of unchanged drug appears in human urine within 6 to 8 hours after dosing. Fecal excretion is negligible. GHB has a mean terminal elimination half-life of 0.66 hours.<br/>

                              <paragraph>The pharmacokinetics of GHB in 16 cirrhotic patients, half without ascites (Child’s Class A) and half with ascites (Child’s Class C), were compared to the kinetics in 8 subjects with normal hepatic function after a single sodium oxybate oral dose of 25 mg/kg. AUC values were double in the cirrhotic patients, with apparent oral clearance reduced from 9.1 mL/min/kg in healthy adults to 4.5 and 4.1 mL/min/kg in Class A and Class C patients, respectively. Elimination half-life was significantly longer in Class C and Class A patients than in control patients (mean t<sub>1/2</sub> of 59 and 32 minutes, respectively, versus 22 minutes). The starting dose of XYWAV should be reduced in patients with hepatic impairment <content styleCode="italics">[see Dosage and Administration (</content>

                     <title>14.1 Cataplexy and Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS) in Adult Narcolepsy</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Efficacy of XYWAV for the treatment of cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness in adult patients with narcolepsy was established in a double‑blind, placebo‑controlled, randomized‑withdrawal study (Study 1; NCT03030599). This study had two parts, consisting of the main study, followed by an optional 24-week open‑label extension (OLE). The main study consisted of a 12‑week open-label optimized treatment and titration period (OL OTTP), followed by a 2-week stable-dose period (SDP), and finally a 2‑week double-blind randomized-withdrawal period (DB RWP).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Study 1 enrolled 201 patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy, 18 to 70 years of age, with a baseline history of at least 14 cataplexy attacks in a typical 2-week period prior to any treatment for narcolepsy symptoms. Of the 201 patients, 134 were randomized 1:1 to continue treatment with XYWAV or to placebo in the 2‑week DB RWP. In the safety population, overall, the median age was 36.0 years (range: 18 to 70). The majority of subjects were female (61%), and most were white (88%) and not Hispanic or Latino (84%).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients entering the study were taking a stable dosage of 1) Xyrem only, 2) Xyrem + another anticataplectic, 3) a non-Xyrem anticataplectic, or 4) were cataplexy‑treatment naïve. Patients taking Xyrem at study entry were switched (at a gram for gram dose) from Xyrem to XYWAV for a minimum of 2 weeks and titrated, if needed, to a stable, tolerable, and effective dosage over 8 weeks. Most patients who switched from Xyrem to XYWAV (41/59; 69%) had no change in dosage from study entry to the stable dose period; 27% (16/59) had an increase in dosage, and 3% (2/59) had a decrease in dosage. Among patients whose dosage was changed, most changes were within one titration step (≤1.5 g). Patients not taking Xyrem at study entry were initiated at 4.5 g/night of XYWAV and titrated at a rate of 1 or 1.5 g/night/week to a tolerable dose of XYWAV. Patients taking an anticataplectic other than Xyrem were tapered off the non-Xyrem anticataplectic over 2 to 8 weeks. All patients continued to receive XYWAV only, for the treatment of cataplexy during the last 2 weeks of the OL OTTP.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>CNS stimulants were allowed at entry, and 39% (78/201) of patients continued taking a stable dose of stimulant throughout the SDP and DB RWP. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The total nightly dose of XYWAV was administered in two equally divided doses in 90% (62/69) of patients. Unequal doses were administered in 10% (7/69) of patients treated with XYWAV.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in frequency of cataplexy attacks from the 2 weeks of the SDP to the 2 weeks of the DB RWP. The key secondary endpoint was the change in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score, as a measure of reduction in EDS from the end of the SDP to the end of the DB RWP. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients taking stable doses of XYWAV who discontinued XYWAV treatment and were randomized to placebo during the DB RWP experienced a significant worsening in the average weekly number of cataplexy attacks and in ESS score, compared with patients randomized to continue treatment with XYWAV (see Table 4). </paragraph>

                     <title>14.2 Cataplexy and Excessive Daytime Sleepiness in Pediatric Narcolepsy </title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The effectiveness of XYWAV in pediatric patients is based upon a clinical study in patients treated with Xyrem, as described below, and additional pharmacokinetic information <content styleCode="italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (<linkHtml href="#ID_fb29baf6-88cb-4e7a-a151-4dca2466eaad">8.4</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The effectiveness of Xyrem in the treatment of cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness in pediatric patients 7 years of age and older with narcolepsy was established in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized-withdrawal study (NCT02221869). The study was conducted in 106 pediatric patients (median age: 12 years; range: 7 to 17 years) with a baseline history of at least 14 cataplexy attacks in a typical 2-week period prior to any treatment for narcolepsy symptoms. Of the 106 patients, 2 did not receive study drug and 63 patients were randomized 1:1 either to continued treatment with Xyrem or to placebo. Randomization to placebo was stopped early as the efficacy criterion was met at the pre-planned interim analysis. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients entered the study either taking a stable dosage of Xyrem or were Xyrem-naïve. CNS stimulants were allowed at entry, and approximately 50% of patients continued taking a stable dose of stimulant throughout the stable-dose and double-blind periods. Xyrem-naïve patients were initiated and titrated based on body weight over a period of up to 10 weeks. The total nightly dose was administered in two divided doses, with the first dose given at nighttime and the second given 2.5 to 4 hours later <content styleCode="italics">[see Dosage and Administration (<linkHtml href="#ID_9006dba2-99db-40e2-822c-d0f0b1883e8c">2.2</linkHtml>)]</content>. Once a stable dosage of Xyrem had been achieved, these patients entered the 2-week stable-dose period; patients on a stable dosage of Xyrem at study entry remained on this dosage for 3 weeks, prior to randomization. Efficacy was established at dosages ranging from 3 g to 9 g of Xyrem per night.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary efficacy measure was the change in frequency of cataplexy attacks. In addition, change in cataplexy severity was evaluated with the Clinical Global Impression of Change for cataplexy severity. The efficacy of Xyrem in the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness in pediatric patients with narcolepsy was evaluated with the change in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (Child and Adolescent) score. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (Child and Adolescent) is a modified version of the scale used in adult clinical trials described above. The overall change in narcolepsy condition was assessed by the Clinical Global Impression of Change for narcolepsy overall. Efficacy was assessed during or at the end of the 2-week double-blind treatment period, relative to the last 2 weeks or end of the stable-dose period (see Tables 5 and 6).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Pediatric patients taking stable dosages of Xyrem who discontinued Xyrem treatment and were randomized to placebo during the double-blind treatment period experienced a statistically significant increase in weekly cataplexy attacks compared with patients who were randomized to continue treatment with Xyrem. Patients randomized to receive placebo during the double-blind treatment period experienced a statistically significant worsening of EDS compared with patients randomized to continue receiving Xyrem (see Table 5).</paragraph>
